## Install
fluxos package is designed to work with the most modern tools such as [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

(Recommended method) Using Node's NPM:

```sh
$ npm install --save fluxos
```

Alternatively, you can serve the file fluxos.js found at the 'compat' directory of this repository.
This is the concated and minified version, which includes the compiled/* and Flux.min.js files.

```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodets/fluxos/master/compat/fluxos.js"> </script>
```

Sometimes I may also ask you to install the latest version from Github to check
if a bugfix is working. In this case, please do:

```sh
$ npm install --save nodets/fluxos
```

## Principles of fluxos

- Fast.

- Simplicity Equals Productivity. The best way to make something seem simple is to have it actually be simple. fluxos' main functionality has clean, classically beautiful APIs

- Minimalistic.

- With love to ES6 and Typescript developers.
